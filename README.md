# English-Amharic-parallel-corpus
This repository caontains  English-Amharic parallel corpus . We used different tools and techniques to collect the parallel corpus. As the main tools HTTrack and Heritrix are utilized to crawl and archive different websites and news blogs. Additionally, we downloaded a considerable amount of legal documents from different sources. Finally, we extracted the parallelly aligned text data from the collected raw data and merged them into a single UTF-8 file for each language. Still now we have collected a total of 225,304 sentences for each language.
